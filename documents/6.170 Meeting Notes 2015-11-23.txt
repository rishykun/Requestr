11- 23 Meeting Notes
Don’t need automated tests but need clean code
MVP Too simple – Just CRUD
-	Implement tags for MVP
-	Implement discussion?
Additional Features
	-Venmo Integration for enforcing rewards
	- Linkedin integration not ideal because skills are usually work related/ not relevant to requests
Split workload by tasks not frontend backend
