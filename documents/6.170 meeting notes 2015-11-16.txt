concepts are not concepts


request, tag are concepts
review is not a concept
message concept needs to be fleshed out more
	not a concept if just a "plain message", like sending text message
	if we want it to have a larger meaning (call it exchange or connection),


suggestions: division of categories

insights for data model, what the problem we are modeling with our data model

user design picture too small, not able to see the contents


separate the operational principle from the concept (slide)
app currently CRUD, not sophisticated enough, only MVP right now
	i.e.

suggestions for additional features:

	authentication:
		email verification
		using MIT certificate to authenticate //very hard

	integrating email
	integrating text message
	integrating facebook
	integrating linkedin

	algorithm that selects things for you for food or w/e
	algorithm that parses linkedin skills that 



	ordering algorithm *

	project tasks instead of 1-1 (multiple request-takers)

	admin vs regular users for the app





need threat model, what types of attacks we should be expecting

design challenges:
	better format, like bullet points



MVP requirements:
	login system
	CRUD request
	status on requests

	request tags (if time permits)
	rating system (if time permits)


todo:
	divide roles



indicate what parts we changed, improved for the revised design
